## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/)

### What I learned

I learned that building CSS with the BEM methodology is easier with SASS nesting.


### Continued development

I want to use BEM more and dive further into Flexbox. There were some areas that confused me about Flexbox, mainly things not working.

### Useful resources

- [BEM video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKenj9ZQwJg) - This video helped me understand BEM. I read the offical docs afterward.
